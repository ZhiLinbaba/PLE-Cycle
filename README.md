# PLE-Cycle
seismic parameter inversion based on PLE-Cycle
# Dataset acquisition
dataset.rar is dataset

model_data.rar is data of seam model

Network.rar is network need in this code

PLE.py is train code for PLE,need to load dataset from dataset,and input model_pt of trained network

PLE_semi.py is train code for PLE_semi,need to load dataset from dataset,and input model_pt of trained network

single.py is train code for single,need to load dataset from dataset,and input model_pt of trained network

single_semi.py is train code for single_semi,need to load dataset from dataset,and input model_pt of trained network

test_for_single is test code for single and single-semi.need to load seismic data and vs,vp,imp data from model_data, model_pt trained before.in the end ,it inputs the predict and ture value,and the erro.

test_for_PLE is test code for PLE and PLE-semi.need to load seismic data and vs,vp,imp data from model_data, model_pt trained before.in the end ,it inputs the predict and ture value,and the erro.
